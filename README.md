# Revenue Computation App

This application computes various types of revenue from a dataset using Docker. The dataset contains customer orders, and the application performs the following tasks:

- Compute the total revenue generated by the online store for each month.
- Compute the total revenue generated by each product.
- Compute the total revenue generated by each customer.
- Identify the top 10 customers by revenue.

## Project Structure

- `compute_monthly_revenue.py`: Computes revenue by month.
- `compute_product_revenue.py`: Computes revenue by product.
- `compute_customer_revenue.py`: Computes revenue by customer.
- `top_10_customers.py`: Identifies the top 10 customers by revenue.
- `run_all_scripts.py`: Runs all the scripts sequentially.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages.
- `Dockerfile`: Defines how to build the Docker image.
- `docker-compose.yml` (optional): Manages Docker containers.
- `orders.csv` (for testing or initial setup): Sample dataset.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to build and run the Dockerized application:

### Prerequisites

- Docker (and optionally Docker Compose) installed on your machine.

### Building the Docker Image

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/namankumar234/revenue-computation-app.git
    cd revenue-computation-app
    ```

2. Build the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t revenue-computation-app .
    ```

### Running the Application

To run the Docker container with the dataset:

1. Ensure you have `orders.csv` in the project directory or adjust the path in the `Dockerfile` if needed.

2. Run the Docker container:

    ```bash
    docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/orders.csv:/app/orders.csv revenue-computation-app
    ```

   This command mounts `orders.csv` into the Docker container and executes the `run_all_scripts.py` script, which in turn runs all the revenue computation scripts.

### Using Docker Compose (Optional)

If you prefer using Docker Compose, you can manage the container with a `docker-compose.yml` file.

1. Use Docker Compose to build and run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

### Scripts Overview

- **`compute_monthly_revenue.py`**: Calculates total revenue for each month from the dataset.
- **`compute_product_revenue.py`**: Calculates total revenue for each product from the dataset.
- **`compute_customer_revenue.py`**: Calculates total revenue for each customer and identifies the top 10 customers.
- **`top_10_customers.py`**: Specifically identifies the top 10 customers by revenue.

### Development

To modify or add new functionality:

1. Update or add new Python scripts in the project directory.
2. Rebuild the Docker image to include the changes:

    ```bash
    docker build -t revenue-computation-app .
    ```

3. Run the Docker container to test your changes.
